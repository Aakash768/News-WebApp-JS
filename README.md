# Basic News App
This is a simple **News App** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app fetches live news from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and displays them in containers on the page. You can also search for specific news articles using the search bar. Clicking on any news container will redirect you to the full article.
